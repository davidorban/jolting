Quantum computers have been under development for decades. Are they about to start delivering on their promise?
Jolting technologies, where the acceleration is increasing, can burst onto the scene very suddenly.
The quantum phenomena, on which the new architectures are based, needed a long time to be understood and applied. We are still in the process of making quantum computers reliable, and useful. There are several bottlenecks, and one of the most surprising one is the need for new algorithms and of an entire software stack that can take full advantage of quantum computers.
Large companies not only are preparing new quantum computers, but they are also making available platforms for anybody to learn about them and experiment freely with them. New ideas are very valuable and quantum computers represent an exciting new playground for creating value and opportunities.
