# About Jolting Technologies

## The Hypothesis

The Jolting Technologies Hypothesis posits that technological progress occurs in phases of exponential growth punctuated by sudden "jolts" - periods of super-exponential acceleration that fundamentally alter the technological landscape.

## Key Concepts

- **Exponential Growth**: Steady, predictable advancement in capabilities
- **Jolts**: Discontinuous jumps where progress accelerates dramatically
- **Governance Lag**: The challenge of societal institutions adapting to rapid change

## Implications

These jolts present unique challenges for:
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Policy development
- International coordination
- Ethical considerations

## Our Approach

We combine empirical analysis, simulation modeling, and governance theory to understand and prepare for technological jolts.
