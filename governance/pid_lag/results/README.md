# Governance PID-Lag Results Directory

This directory contains results from the Governance PID-Lag Toy Model simulations.

## Structure

- `figures/` - Generated visualizations
  - `pid_lag_simulation.png` - Main visualization from standard simulation
  - `pid_lag_parameter_exploration.png` - Visualization of parameter exploration

- `data/` - Simulation data
  - `pid_lag_no_governance.csv` - Simulation results without governance
  - `pid_lag_with_governance.csv` - Simulation results with governance

- `tables/` - LaTeX tables for publication
  - `pid_lag_results.tex` - Summary table of simulation results

## Usage

The files in this directory are automatically generated by the scripts in the parent directory. You can regenerate them by running:

```bash
python run_pid_lag_model.py
```

## Integration with Manuscript

The figures and tables in this directory are designed to be directly included in the Jolting Technologies manuscript. The LaTeX tables can be copied into the paper's source, and the figures can be referenced from the paper.
