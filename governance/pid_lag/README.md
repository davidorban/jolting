# Governance PID-Lag Toy Model

This directory contains the implementation of the Governance PID-Lag Toy Model for the Jolting Technologies Hypothesis paper. It provides a framework for simulating governance responses to technological acceleration and jolts using a PID controller with time lag.

## Overview

The Governance PID-Lag Toy Model simulates the interaction between technological progress (potentially experiencing jolts) and governance mechanisms that attempt to regulate risk. The model uses a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller with time lag to represent governance responses, capturing key real-world challenges:

1. **Response Delay**: Governance mechanisms take time to detect and respond to technological changes
2. **Implementation Time**: Policies and regulations take time to fully implement
3. **Effectiveness Decay**: Governance effectiveness decays over time without continued attention
4. **Limited Effectiveness**: Governance has a maximum achievable effectiveness

## Components

### PID Controller with Lag

The `controller.py` module implements a PID controller with time lag:

- **PID Controller**: Adjusts governance response based on:
  - Proportional term: Immediate response to current risk
  - Integral term: Response to accumulated risk over time
  - Derivative term: Response to rate of change in risk

- **Lag Model**: Simulates real-world governance challenges:
  - Response delay: Time before governance begins to respond
  - Response time: Time to reach full implementation
  - Effectiveness decay: Reduction in effectiveness over time
  - Effectiveness cap: Maximum achievable effectiveness

### Technology Progress Model

The `technology.py` module implements models for technological progress:

- **Exponential Growth**: Base model for technological advancement
- **Jolt Effects**: Super-exponential acceleration periods
- **Risk Calculation**: Logistic function mapping technology level to risk
- **Governance Effects**: How governance actions impact technology progress

## Usage

```bash
# Run a basic simulation with default parameters
python run_pid_lag_model.py

# Run with custom parameters
python run_pid_lag_model.py --jolt-time 50 --jolt-magnitude 0.3 --response-delay 5 --response-time 10

# Run with no jolt (for baseline comparison)
python run_pid_lag_model.py --jolt-time -1
```

## Key Parameters

### Lag Model Parameters
- `response-delay`: Time steps before governance begins to respond
- `response-time`: Time steps to reach full implementation
- `decay-rate`: Rate at which governance effectiveness decays
- `effectiveness-cap`: Maximum governance effectiveness
